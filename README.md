# ur_robotics_workshops
This repository contains code and writeups for a number of workshops designed to teach introductory robotics concepts to the members of the Robotics Club at the University of Rochester. Current workshops are listed in the table below with the name of the directory in which to find its content, as well as its order in a workshop series, if applicable. In general, we expect the Intro to Robotics workshop series to be completed first, and skills learned in this series will likely be necessary for other workshops.

| Topic | Directory | Series | 
|---|---|---|
| Intro to Programming  | intro_to_programming  | Intro to Robotics WS 4 |
| 2D Forward Kinematics  | forward_kinematics  | Intro to Robotics WS 5 | 
| Planning with A*  | planning_with_a_star  | Intro to Robotics WS 6 |
| Inverse Kinematics  | inverse_kinematics_workshop  | N/A |
| Markov Decision Processes  | markov_decision_processes  | N/A |

Intro to Robotics Workshops 1-3 are focused on  robot construction and are not in this repository. They can be found on [our website](https://ccc.rochester.edu/urrobotics/workshops/).
